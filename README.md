I'm Lendl Peralta, I recently graduated at Lighthouse Labs with a diploma in Web Development. My passion in tech started 27 years ago when the movie 'Hackers' came out and I really wanted to be a hacker 😂. Fastforward to 2004, I graduated with a degree in BS Information Technology at Saint Louis University. I worked mostly on hardware and software support and while I was supporting a couple of developers, my curiousity about coding started again so that's when I decided to enroll at Lighthouse Labs to sharpen my skills. What got me going in pursuing web development is the journey of creating an app from start to end and collaborating with different peers, sharing ideas and working in finding bugs 🐞 then get that 'aha!' moment and looking at the final output and be proud to say "We made this! 😎".
